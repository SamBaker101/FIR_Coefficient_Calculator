# Filter_Coeff_Calculator
 
 A calculator script to generate coefficients for FIR filters. 
 
 Calculator is still under construction. Sinc function calculations now working to produce normalized coefficients for low pass filters. No window function implemented as yet. Can currently only work with even tap numbers.
